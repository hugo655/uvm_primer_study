# UVM Primer

Learning UVM its nice! Yet setting-up the environment is not straightforward. One can do it the easy way or the hard way. 
In my opinion, learning how to setup tools, specially EDA-tools, is a relevant skill. Some people do disagree, but at the end of the day, I like the feeling of understanding a bit of how things work 'under the hood'.

Seting-up tools take time to learn. The final result is often a handful of scripts that work as a toolbox. Personal scripts that save  you time in future projects. However, since the focus the learning journey is UVM, I am leaving the part a bit aside. 

I am fortunate to work in research center that happen to have  academic licenses for Cadence EDA tools. I'll be using them for these experiments in this learning journey. 

Most of the pieces of code I'll post here use as reference the book's [oficital GITHUB Page]([raysalemi/uvmprimer: Contains the code examples from The UVM Primer Book sorted by chapters. (github.com)](https://github.com/raysalemi/uvmprimer)).
