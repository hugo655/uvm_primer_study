# UVM Primer
These pages are my personal notes taken from the book [The UVM Primer](https://www.amazon.com.br/Uvm-Primer-Step-Step-Introduction/dp/0974164933).  Any codes in here refer to [this Github repository]([hugo655/uvm_primer_study: A repository to host notes and codes of my study of UVM (github.com)](https://github.com/hugo655/uvm_primer_study))which I am using to save my progress, including these notes.


## On Having Access to UVM
Learning UVM is nice! Yet, setting-up the environment is not straightforward. One can do it the easy way or the hard way. 

In my opinion, learning how to setup tools, specially EDA-tools, is a relevant skill. Some people do disagree, but at the end of the day, I like the feeling of understanding a bit of how things work 'under the hood'.

Setting-up tools take time to learn. The final result is often a handful of scripts that work as a toolbox. Personal scripts that save  you time in future projects. However, since the focus the learning journey is UVM, I am leaving the part a bit aside. 

I am fortunate to work in research center that happen to have  academic licenses for Cadence EDA tools. I'll be using them for these experiments in this learning journey. Maybe one day I may write some other setup script for another tool such as *Questa*. As far as I know, there isn't any open-source simulator that supports UVM integrally. However, a good free alternative is [EDA Playground]([RESEARCH PROJECTS â€“ RTEMSOFT (edaplayground.com)](https://www.edaplayground.com/)). Nevertheless, I wrote a bit about [Setting-up UVM with Cadence Tools](/Notas_de_Livros/uvm_primer/uvm-setup.md).
